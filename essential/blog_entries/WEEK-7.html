<h2>WEEK-7</h2>
<p>
    In seventh week I have implemented various MongoDB and Mongoose related experiments

    <h4>EXP-1:</h4>
    Implemented an experiment as an introduction to MongoDB where I am accessing data from the DB.

    <h4>EXP-2</h4>
    Implemented a MongoDb experiment wherein I am finding data from the DB. It is similar to select from table query in SQL.

    <h4>EXP-3</h4>
    Implemented an experiment to count the number of entries in MongoDB amd to findOne entry in DB based on some criteria.

    <h4>EXP-4</h4>
    Implemented an experiment to create a form that fetches data from MongoDB displays it. User can also add a new data as well as delete existing data.

    <h4>EXP-5</h4>

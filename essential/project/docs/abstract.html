        <p>
            This course is one of the most practice oriented courses that I have taken in my masters program. 
            Learning by experimenting has been a great experience, under the guidance of eminent faculty.
            I would like to thank and express my gratitude to Dr Jose Annunziato. His encouragement, and immense knowledge were key motivations
            throughout my course. Professor Jose  allowed us to learn new technologies like node.js,mongodb,angular js for which I am greatful.
            I would like to thank my TA Sandeep  for oﬀering thorough and excellent feedback on an earlier experiments of this course and thanks for making sure that I was following in the correct path.
            I woud also take this opportunity to thank my TA Snehal Vankireddy who helped me with my experiments, as she always was available to give her feedback on experiments
            and always let me know where I can improve.

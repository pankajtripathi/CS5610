                <p>
                    This course is one of the most practice oriented courses that I have taken in my masters program.
                    Learning by experimenting has been a great experience, under the guidance of eminent faculty.
                    I would like to thank and express my gratitude to Dr Jose Annunziato. His encouragement, and immense knowledge were key motivations
                    throughout my course. Professor Jose  allowed us to learn new technologies like node.js,mongodb,angular js for which I am greatful.
            
                    I woud also take this opportunity to thank my TA Sneha Vankireddy who helped me with my experiments, as she always was available to give her feedback on experiments
                    and always let me know where I can improve.

                <br /><br />
                <p>
                    I have used bootstrap for styling the home page. In the homepage I have mentioned some of the basic services
                    provided by this site like movies in theaters, searching a movie, movie reviews, movie watchlist and so on. I have provided
                    a responsive navbar at the top of the page which has all the basic navigation links.

                <p>
                    The login page is provided in order to enable user to login into his account and add movies to his watch list.
                    Once user logs in he/she can search and add movies he/she wishes to watch sometime later and once done watching

                <br />
                <h4>Login Controller</h4>
                <p>
                    Login services are designed using Node.js and Express Module. MongoDB is used for storing all the user data. 
                    Since the web page is implemented as a single page website, angular routing is used to route pages and 
                    for login a controller is used to complete login action.

            <div>
                <h4>Data Storage: MongoDB</h4>
                <p>
                    A lot of data is handled in the project, for backend storage purpose I am using MongoDB which is a no SQL database. In mongoDB there are collections instead of tables and documents (JSON Objects) instead of tupples.
                    The Coolections for my project are :
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Usermodels:</b> This collection is used to store the user details.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Movmodels:</b> This collection is used to store the users movies in movie watchlist along with the username.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <h3>Future Scope and References</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>Future Scope</h4>
                <ul>
                 
                   <li>In future I will be adding sorting functionality on movie result pages. User will be able to sort the movies based on the details provided
                    at the header of the search result.</li> 
                    <li>I will also be adding functionality to add some more details to profile.</li>
                    <li>I will also be functionality to review movie and add it my movies page.</li>

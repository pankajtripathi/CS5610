            <h3>The Forza Football App – Letting Fan Opinions Get Heard</h3>
            <p id="para-one">
                Forza Football is designed to solve one of football’s most fundamental problems – that when trying to get a sense of fan opinion, pundits and decision-makers have to rely on isolated, anecdotal comments from social media that can never be truly representative.
            </p>
            <p>
                Forza Football’s innovative features offer fans increased engagement with the game, by giving users the opportunity to vote on fundamental match-related questions, such as: ‘Do you have confidence in Man Utd’s manager?’; ‘Do you have confidence in Man Utd’s chairman?’; and ‘Do you have faith in the current squad?’. Users of the Forza Football app are able to select their favoured response and, to ensure that the decision of each fan is independently made, the cumulative results of the live poll are displayed only after a vote has been cast. Revolutionizing the relationship between fans and the game that they love, now the opinions of fans can be collated and viewed as one, no longer being concluded unscientifically from Twitter or based upon a pundit’s intuition.

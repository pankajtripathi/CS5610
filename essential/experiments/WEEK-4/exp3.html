    <h3>Code Snippet</h3>
    <p>In the code given below I have created an angularJS app called controllerDemo. For this app I have created an app controller which fetches data from the model and then it is displayed on the page.</p>
    <p>Funtion <b>function ($scope)</b> defines scope for model. The data for this is obtained as the user types data in the textbox which is later dispalyed</p>
    <code>
        &emsp;var app = angular.module("controllerDemo", []);<br />
        &emsp;app.controller("expController",<br />
        &emsp;function ($scope) {<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;console.log("Controller Demo");<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;var name = { fName: "", lName: "" };<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;$scope.name = name;<br />
        &emsp;});
    </code>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>AngularJS, commonly referred to as Angular, is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. Its goal is to simplify both development and testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, along with components commonly used in rich internet applications.</p>
    <p>In this experiment I have provided two textboxes wherein user will enter his/her name. The name entered will be displayed as a single text(fullname of user)</p>

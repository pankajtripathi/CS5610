        <h3>Code Snippet</h3>
        <p>In this code using controller I create an array of students which I will display on the webpage. The students in the array students can removed dynamically or a new student can be added to the array by the user. To add a new student user has to click on "+" and to remove he/she has to click on "X". To remove the student I obtain the idex of the student for which the button is clicked and i just splice it from the array.
        To add a student I obtain the details from the view and push it to arary of students.</p>
        <code>
            &emsp;app = angular.module("controllerDemo", []);<br />
            &emsp;app.controller("expController",<br />
            &emsp;function ($scope) {<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;var students = [<br />

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>AngularJS, commonly referred to as Angular, is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. Its goal is to simplify both development and testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, along with components commonly used in rich internet applications.</p>
        <p>In this experiment I am displaying list of all the students from the array students. Along with this I have also provided a functionality to add a new student</p>

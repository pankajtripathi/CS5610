        <h3>Code Snippet</h3>
        <p>
            In this code I have created an app call MyNoteApp. I am saving my text in <b>$scope.message</b>. I am showing the characters left by deducting the text entered with permissible limit of 100 characters. I have provided a functionality to save the note with the date. I have added the title of the note and the date it was created in an array called notes which I am dispalying on the page
        </p>
        <code>
            &emsp; app = angular.module("MyNoteApp", []);<br />
            &emsp;app.controller("myNoteCtrl", function ($scope) {<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;$scope.notes = [];<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;$scope.message = "";<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;$scope.left = function () {<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;var rem = 100 - $scope.message.length;<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return rem;<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;};<br />

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>AngularJS, commonly referred to as Angular, is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. Its goal is to simplify both development and testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, along with components commonly used in rich internet applications.</p>
        <p>In this experiment I am providing user a functionality to create a new note and save that note.The character limit is 100 characters. The note is saved with a title and date it was created.</p>
